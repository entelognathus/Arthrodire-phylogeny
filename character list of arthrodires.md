> - Carr and Hlavin (2010): "Carr (1991) noted some uncertainty over whether the closure of the sensory angle (correlated with enlarged orbits) is plesiomorphic or independently derived among several groups within the Aspinothoracidi. Gardiner & Miles (1994) argued that selenosteids clearly share a condition of an angle less than 45° (a synapomorphy of the Selenosteidae, as noted by Lelièvre et al. 1987). However, Lelièvre et al. (1987), Carr (1991), and Gardiner & Miles (1994) concurred that Gy. hydei is the sister group of the Selenosteidae. In a redescription of Gy. hydei, Carr (1994) showed that the angle was smaller than 40°, and, based on other characters, placed this genus as a higher nested member within the Selenosteidae. Carr (1996) corroborated that placement of Gy. hydei within the Selenosteidae in an analysis of Selenosteus Dean, 1901a and Stenosteus Dean, 1901a."

> - Carr and Hlavin (2010): "Gardiner & Miles (1994) argued that the angle between these grooves in *Homostius* and *Buchanosteus* is opened, in contrast to the interpretations of Lelièvre (in part, 1984a) and Carr (1991). We assume that this discrepancy was based on differing interpretations of the terms open and closed. As originally used by Lelièvre (1984a), and followed by Carr (1991), the angle in consideration was the anterior or anterodorsal-facing angle formed by the postorbital and suborbital branches of the infraorbital sensory line groove (Lelièvre, 1984a, angle formed by sio and sio.sb, fig. 2A). This feature is considered here to be closed in Homostius (Heintz, 1934, fig. 22), polymorphic in *Buchanosteus* (sensu Young, 1979); opened in *B. confertituberculatus* (Young, 1979: fig. 13, pl. 3), and closed in *B. ‘murrumbidgeensis’* (White, 1952) (White &Toombs, 1972: fig. 24; pl. 8, fig. 3), and opened in the other taxa."

In some clades, the posterior and anterior parts are not directly connected by the deep groove, but through the shallow sulcus, such as in the *Coccosteus cuspidatus* and *Millerosteus minor*. This condition possibly indicates that the shallow sulcus between the anterior and posterior part of posterior pit line is connecting by the sensory canal, as in Petalichthys. However, in the *Coccosteus cuspidatus*, the state of the character is influence by the ontogeny, with some specimens display the anterior is not connected with the posterior.

This plate (P50937) is structurally the same as that described for *Harrytoombsia*, except for the postocular crista which is proportionally much narrower and less robust. However, it does broaden anteriorly to form a substantial subocular crista. Also, the overlap area on the dorsal surface (PN.oa, Fig. 11B) receives the postnasal plate and not the preorbital lamina of the preorbital plate as is the case with *Harrytoombsia*". Rucklin (2011): "The visceral surface bears fused sub- and postocular crista, which form the ventral and posterior borders of the orbital vault. The subocular crista broadens anteriorly and is 5 mm wide lateromedially (Text-fig. 6C–D)."

A much smaller cu.s.o was described in a similar position in *Brindabellaspis* (Young 1980), but these are variably developed, and are no wider than the sensory line canals. Since the sensory lines are variably developed as canals or grooves in *Brindabellaspis* it is not clear that these ‘cutaneous sensory organs’ are not continuations of the sensory lines, so this character is scored as unknown in *Brindabellaspis*. A cluster of Cu.s.o pits is also labelled in a posterior region in *Eurycaraspis* (Liu 1991). Since these are a cluster in an unusual position *Eurycaraspis* is currently scored as unknown for this character.
